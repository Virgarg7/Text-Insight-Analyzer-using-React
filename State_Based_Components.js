// First, import useState Bulit-in Hook from React:
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyButton() {
    // Now you can declare a state variable inside your component:
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
    // Youâ€™ll get two things from useState: the current state (count), and the function that lets you update it (setCount). You can give them any names, but the convention is to write [something, setSomething].

    // The first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to useState(). When you want to change state, call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:

    function handleClick() {
      setCount(count + 1);
    }
  
    return (
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Clicked {count} times
      </button>
    );
  }
